            <p>In this experiment you will be presented with a series of tasks. For each task you will be presented with a grayscale image for you to familiarize yourself with. Afterwards, you will be presented with two variant images in pixelated black and white. You must choose one of the two based on the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The image that most closely resembles the original.</li>
                <li>The image that best preserves details.</li>
                <li>The image that best preserves textures.</li>
                <li>The image with least artifacts or confusing patterns.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After each task you will see a cooldown screen where you must wait for a bit. This is to help your eyes rest between each task.</p>
            <p>You can advance by pressing the "Next" button at the bottom or the <kbd>S</kbd> key. You can choose an image by pressing on it or with the <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd> keys. If you must conclude the experiment early, you can press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to skip to the end, where you can get the results to send them my way.</p>
            <p>Before you start, it's important for you to calibrate your display</p>
