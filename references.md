Our algorithm extends Floyd‐Steinberg error diffusion; the goal of our extension is not only to produce good tone similarity but also to preserve structure and especially contrast, motivated by our intuition that human perception is sensitive to contrast. By enhancing contrast we attempt to preserve and enhance structure also.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>In this paper, we describe the use of threshold modulation to remove the visual artifacts contained in the variable-coefficient error-diffusion algorithm. To obtain a suitable parameter set for the threshold modulation, a cost function used for the search of optimal parameters is designed. An optimal diffusion parameter set, as well as the corresponding threshold modulation strength values, is thus obtained. Experiments over this new set of parameters show that, compared with the original variable-coefficient error-diffusion algorithm, threshold modulation can remove visual anomalies more effectively. The result of the new algorithm is an artifact-free halftoning in the full range of intensities. Fourier analysis of the experimental results further support this conclusion.</p>},

    abstract = {As computers proliferate and as the field of computer graphics matures, it has become increasingly important for computer scientists to understand how users perceive and interpret computer graphics. Experimental Design: From User Studies to Psychophysics is an accessible introduction to psychological experiments and experimental design, covering the major components in the design, execution, and analysis of perceptual studies. The book begins with an introduction to the concepts central to designing and understanding experiments, including developing a research question, setting conditions and controls, and balancing specificity with generality. The book then explores in detail a number of types of experimental tasks: free description, rating scales, forced-choice, specialized multiple choice, and real-world tasks as well as physiological studies. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each type and provides examples of that type of experiment from the authors own work. The book also covers stimulus-related issues, including popular stimulus resources. It concludes with a thorough examination of statistical techniques for analyzing results, including methods specific to individual tasks.}
